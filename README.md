# kiek
kiek (/ˈkiːk/ - Northern German for Look!) is a command line tool to look into Kafka topics, especially, if they are "complicated", e.g. behind IAM in AWS MSK and contain AVRO messages with schemas in AWS Glue Schema Registry. kiek analyzes the message in a topic, looks up corresponding schemas and prints the payloads in a human-readable format.
